# Where should I Eatsy?

As an Etsy intern, I always looked forward to our catered lunches. Best food of the week, every week with awesome vegan/vegetarian support.
The lunches were wonderfully called Eatsy.

Inspired by Eatsy, I made a quick little webapp with Erica, to show users Eatsy Restaurants near you!

To check it out, go to

We only backfilled a couple dozen restaurants, and only in NYC.

Yes yes, I don't have an ssh cert. Sorry.
